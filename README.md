Introduction
This project demonstrates sentiment analysis on text data. The text data is first preprocessed by converting to lowercase and removing punctuation. The sentiments are then classified using a logistic regression model trained on TF-IDF features.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Convert text to lowercase and remove punctuation.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Transform text data into numerical features.
Logistic Regression Model: Train and test a model to classify sentiment.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using accuracy and classification reports.

Model
The model used is a logistic regression classifier. It is trained on the TF-IDF features of the preprocessed text data.

Results
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and a detailed classification report. This includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
